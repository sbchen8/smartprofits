      <h2>Smart Profits Auto Trader Profit Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Every effort has been made to accurately represent our site (www.smartprofits.com) 

and our products. While this industry is one of the few sources where one can be 

financially independent, there is no guarantee that you (the client) will earn any 

money using the techniques and concepts in our site's (www.smartprofits.com) 

materials. Testimonials or examples in these materials are not to be interpreted as a 

promise or guarantee of earnings. The profit potential varies from person to person 

and is entirely dependent on the individual. Your level of success in attaining the 

results claimed in our materials depends on the time you devote to the program and 

the implementation of the concepts and methods, your finances, knowledge, and 

various skills. Since these factors differ according to individuals, we cannot guarantee 

your success or income level. Success in any money-making opportunity is a result 

of hard work, time and a variety of other factors. No express or implied guarantees 

of income are made by Smart Profits Auto Trader. Nor are we responsible for any of 

your actions.</p>
        <p>Smart Profits Auto Trader denies our products and services as a "get rich scheme."

We are happy to verify any claims made of actual earnings or examples of actual 

results upon a written request.</p>
        <p>Materials in our product and our website (www.smartprofits.com) may contain 

information that includes or is based upon projections within the meaning of the 

securities litigation reform act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give our 

expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the 

fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such 

as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," and other 

words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a description of potential 

earnings or financial performance.</p>
        <p>Any and all forward-looking statements here or on any of our sales material are 

intended to express our opinion of earning potential. Many factors determine your 

actual results and no guarantees are made that you will achieve results similar to those 

on our site (www.smartprofits.com) or in our other promotional material. Further, 

no guarantees are made that you will achieve any results from our methods and 

techniques.</p>
